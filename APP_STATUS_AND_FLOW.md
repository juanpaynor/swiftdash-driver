## 📱 Complete App Flow

### 1. App Launch & Authentication
```
App Start → AuthWrapper → Check Session
├── No Session → LoginScreen → SignupScreen (if needed)
└── Valid Session → DriverDashboard
```

### 2. Driver Dashboard Flow
```
DriverDashboard
├── Driver Profile Card (welcome, verification status)
├── Online/Offline Toggle
│   ├── Online → Start location tracking (15-second intervals)

```

### 4. Offer Modal System Flow (CORE INTEGRATION)
```
Customer App calls pair_driver
↓
Database: deliveries.driver_id = driver_uuid
Database: deliveries.status = 'driver_assigned'
↓
RealtimeService detects change
↓
DeliveryOfferModal appears FULL SCREEN
├── 5-minute countdown timer
├── Vibration alerts (every 30 seconds)
├── Route preview map
├── Earnings calculation
├── Accept Button → status: 'pickup_arrived'
├── Decline Button → driver_id: null, status: 'pending'
└── Timeout → auto-decline after 5 minutes
```

### 5. Delivery Execution Flow
```
Driver Accepts Offer
↓
Status: 'pickup_arrived' → Driver heading to pickup
↓
Status: 'package_collected' → Driver picked up package
↓
Status: 'in_transit' → Driver en route to customer
↓
Status: 'delivered' → Delivery completed
```

### 6. Location Tracking Flow
```
Driver Goes Online
↓
Request Location Permission
↓

## 🔄 Integration Points with Customer App

### Customer App → Driver App Flow
```
1. Customer creates delivery (book_delivery)
   └── Database: deliveries table, status: 'pending'

2. Customer requests driver (pair_driver)
   └── Function finds closest driver
   └── Database: deliveries.driver_id = closest_driver
   └── Database: deliveries.status = 'driver_assigned'

3. Driver App detects change (realtime subscription)
   └── RealtimeService triggers offer modal
   └── DeliveryOfferModal shows full screen

4. Driver responds
   ├── Accept → status: 'pickup_arrived'
   └── Decline → driver_id: null, status: 'pending'
   
5. If declined, customer app calls pair_driver again
   └── Next closest driver gets offer
```

### Driver App → Customer App Flow
```
1. Driver updates status throughout delivery
   ├── 'pickup_arrived' → Driver at pickup location
   ├── 'package_collected' → Package picked up
   ├── 'in_transit' → En route to customer
   └── 'delivered' → Delivery completed

2. Driver location updates (every 15 seconds)
   └── Customer app can track driver in real-time
```
