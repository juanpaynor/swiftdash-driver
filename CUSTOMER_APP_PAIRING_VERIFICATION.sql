-- üö® CUSTOMER APP PAIRING VERIFICATION
-- Run this IMMEDIATELY after driver goes online to verify pairing will work

-- 1. ‚úÖ CHECK: Drivers meeting ALL customer app criteria

-- 5. üö® EMERGENCY FIX: If still no drivers found, run this
-- UPDATE driver_profiles

--   current_latitude = 14.5995,  -- Manila coordinates as fallback
